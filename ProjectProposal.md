# Project proposal for *Compete in 2016 Kaggle Competition for Rental Listing Inquiries*
Author: Tong Xu

## 1. Why: Question/Topic being investigated 2pts
I would like to participate in a kaggle competition to practice my skills including data analysis, feature extraction, and model tuning.
## 2. How: Plan of attack 2pts
I had joined the Calgary DataScience Academy and they had offered a free course at the start of this year demonstrating the machine learning steps with the 2016 Kaggle Competition "Two Sigma Connect: Rental Listing Inquiries". I will use their workbooks as reference and prepare a notebook for this competition. I will submit my test predictions to evaluate the performance of my machine learning model. 
## 3. What: Dataset, models, framework, components 2pts
* Dataset: from 2016 Kaggle competition "Two Sigma Connect: Rental Listing Inquiries" [link] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-connect-rental-listing-inquiries/data).
* Models: LightGBM
